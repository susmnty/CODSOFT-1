# CODSOFT-1

his Tkinter-based GUI application allows users to manage a to-do list. It has an input field and an "Add Task" button to add tasks, which are stored in a list as dictionaries with an ID, task description, and status. There are also "Update Task" and "Delete Task" buttons to modify and remove tasks, respectively, using the task ID entered in a smaller input field. A listbox displays all tasks with their details. The application uses functions to handle adding, updating, deleting, and listing tasks, with appropriate error handling using message boxes. The mainloop() method keeps the application running, waiting for user interactions.
